# Installation

The FBCTF platform was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for different types of installations depending on the needs of the end user. The FBCTF platform can be installed either in Development Mode, or Production Mode.

[Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/wiki/Quick-Setup-Guide) (_Recommended Installation_)

The [Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/wiki/Quick-Setup-Guide) details the quick setup mode which provides a streamlined and consistent build of the platform but offers less flexibility when compared to a custom installation. If you would prefer to perform a custom installation, please see the [Development Installation Guide](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/wiki/Installation-Guide,-Development) or [Production Installation Guide](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/wiki/Installation-Guide,-Production).
